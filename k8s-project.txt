Today’s focus was on Amazon EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service) and diving deeper into Kubernetes fundamentals and architecture. 🌐⚙️

💡 Key Learnings:
EKS – Managed Kubernetes on AWS
Kubernetes Architecture – Clear understanding of control plane vs data plane
Master Nodes Resources – API server, etcd, scheduler & controller manager
Worker Nodes Resources – kubelet, kube-proxy, container runtime

🔧 Hands-On Experience:
